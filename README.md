### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
```js
const toggleMenu = () => {
  menuOpen.classList.toggle("active")
  menuClose.classList.toggle("active")
  mobileMenu.classList.toggle("active")
}
// Can be shortened by adding active to only one class && then adding Css for adjacent elements.
```

### Continued development
- Css Grid.

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) - This helped me learn css Grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
